things I can fix in Unit 1 project:

I took a quick gander at some of the code I initially wrote for my unit 1 project and I am in shock. The amount I've learned in such a small amount of time really helps with my imposter syndrome. Nevertheless, there is always work to be done. The first thing I would do is clean up the file structure of this code. There is plenty of additional code I could add to make this run smoother, including rewriting this to incorporate React into my source code, but even on a basic level, this file structure is just messy. I would like to first clean and organize this into something more presentable. Additionally, I had audio originally selected to make this a bit more enjoyable, and I would like to implement that to a working condition. If I have time, animation, plus maybe a mobile friendly dynamic would make it a project to be proud of.
