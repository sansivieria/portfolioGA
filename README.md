things I can fix in Unit 1 project:

I took a quick gander at some of the code I initially wrote for my unit 1 project and I am in shock. The amount I've learned in such a small amount of time really helps with my imposter syndrome. Nevertheless, there is always work to be done. The first thing I would do is clean up the file structure of this code. There is plenty of additional code I could add to make this run smoother, including rewriting this to incorporate React into my source code, but even on a basic level, this file structure is just messy. I would like to first clean and organize this into something more presentable. Additionally, I had audio originally selected to make this a bit more enjoyable, and I would like to implement that to a working condition. If I have time, animation, plus maybe a mobile friendly dynamic would make it a project to be proud of.

unit 2:

i would love to turn this into something that actually looks appealing. the idea of selling pizza and computer parts sounds like an inevitable failure considering Newegg and Dominos, everyone has an app so why combine them? i would like to turn this into a better idea eventually, but even just the layout not being cohesive and the headers being differently sized definitely makes me angry.

unit 3:

i wanted to originally turn this into my capstone, but it requires so much more than the alloted time that i have to complete it the way i want to, sure ill have more time post grad to delve into this more, and if i skipped sleeping for our last week of school i could finish this up, but i do think i have something a little more directed towards what i want to do post grad for a career

unit 4:

i really love the design i built for this. it has a couple of bugs, and it wasnt a direct replica of the orignial framework that was given to us via UX team so I think it could use an alt design.

decided to do something new....
